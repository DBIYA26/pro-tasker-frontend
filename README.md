└─ package.json

This structure keeps concerns separated: UI components, data access, and routing are decoupled. It makes it easier to reason about changes and to test components in isolation. The inside of each folder reflects common patterns:

- src/components: Small, reusable blocks like Button, Card, Modal, Avatar, and form controls.
- src/contexts: Global state like auth information and user preferences.
- src/hooks: Encapsulated logic for fetching data, handling auth tokens, and managing loading/error states.
- src/pages: High-level views that assemble components to deliver a complete screen.
- src/routes: Route-level logic, including authentication guards and role checks.
- src/services: API logic that centralizes endpoints, error handling, and retries.

## 🧭 Getting Started

This guide walks you through getting the frontend up and running in your local environment. It assumes a standard MERN backend is in place and reachable via the API endpoints.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.x or newer
- npm (or yarn / pnpm)
- Git

1) Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/DBIYA26/pro-tasker-frontend.git
- cd pro-tasker-frontend

2) Install dependencies
- npm install
- or: yarn install
- or: pnpm install

3) Create a local environment file
- Copy the template: cp .env.local.example .env.local
- Update API_BASE_URL to point to your backend
- Include any needed keys (e.g., JWT secrets, if your app stores them in local storage)

4) Start the development server
- npm run dev
- The app should be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in your terminal)
- If you use a different port, adjust your environment or start script accordingly

5) Access app features
- Open the app in your browser
- If authentication is required, log in with an existing test account or sign up a new one if your backend supports it
- Explore dashboards, projects, tasks, and user management pages

## 🧩 Key Features

- User authentication flow with login, signup, and session persistence
- Role-based access control on the frontend for UI visibility
- Project dashboards with real-time task status updates
- Task creation, assignment, status updates, and comments
- Inline editing and drag-and-drop interactions for efficient task handling
- Responsive, accessible UI with keyboard navigation
- Centralized API handling and error management
- Modularity that supports incremental improvements and testing

These capabilities align with typical project management workflows. The UI focuses on clarity, minimal friction, and predictable interactions to reduce cognitive load during daily work.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Clarity over cleverness: UI decisions favor obvious, discoverable interactions.
- Consistency: uniform components, spacing, and typography for a predictable experience.
- Accessibility: keyboard friendly, screen-reader friendly, and color-contrast aware where feasible.
- Performance: lightweight rendering, memoization where needed, and minimal re-renders.
- Maintainability: clean code, explicit contracts between modules, and clear data flows.

Each page is assembled from small, testable components. The Context API supplies global state to the UI, while custom hooks encapsulate API logic and side effects.

---

## 🧭 How It Works: Data Flow and State Management

- Authentication: The auth context stores user data and JWT tokens after login. The useAuth hook abstracts login, logout, and current user retrieval.
- Data fetching: The useFetch hook standardizes fetch patterns, including loading and error handling. It can be reused for lists, details, and updates.
- API layer: Axios instances are configured with base URLs, interceptors for auth tokens, and error parsing. All API calls go through the services layer to keep components clean.
- Routing: Protected routes ensure certain pages are only accessible to authenticated users. Role checks gate UI elements to support RBAC.
- State: Global UI state (like splash screen visibility, theme toggles, and notification banners) resides in the Context API, while page-specific state lives in local component state.

This architecture keeps business logic out of UI components, improving testability and maintainability.

---

## 🔧 Development and Debugging

- Linting: Use the project’s linting rules to maintain code quality.
- Formatting: Follow the project’s code style, with consistent indentation and naming.
- Debugging: Use browser dev tools. Leverage console logs for API failures, and mock API responses for isolated UI testing.
- Hot reload: The Vite dev server provides fast feedback loops as you modify code.
- Testing: If present, run unit tests to verify components and hooks. Consider end-to-end testing for critical flows like login and task updates.

Common tasks
- Start dev server: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Type checks (if TypeScript is used): npm run type-check

---

## 📦 API and Integration

- Base URL: The frontend talks to the backend via API endpoints. The API client handles token refresh, error codes, and request timeouts.
- Endpoints typically cover:
  - Authentication: login, signup, token refresh
  - Projects: list, detail, create, update, delete
  - Tasks: list, detail, create, update, delete, status changes
  - Users: list, roles, permissions
- Error handling is centralized to provide friendly messages and retry logic when appropriate.

If you use mock data during development, the useFetch hook can be configured to point at mock endpoints while the backend is being built.

---

## 🧭 Code Quality and Quality Assurance

- Code reviews: PRs should include tests or at least a detailed description of changes.
- Testing strategy: unit tests for components, hooks, and services; integration tests for critical flows.
- Accessibility checks: ensure interactive elements are navigable with a keyboard and have proper ARIA attributes.

The project aims to be approachable for new contributors while providing enough structure to handle complex tasks.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap and Future Improvements

- Expand RBAC: Add more granular permissions and audit logs for UI actions.
- Offline support: Persist certain UI states and allow task edits offline with sync when online.
- Real-time updates: Integrate websockets for live task changes and dashboard metrics.
- Performance budgets: Enforce budgets on bundle size and render times.
- Internationalization: Localize UI strings for broader audiences.

The roadmap emphasizes practical improvements that directly impact daily workflows without overcomplicating the design.

## 📚 Documentation and Guides

- Quick Start: A short guide to booting the frontend and connecting to a running backend.
- API Reference: Describes the expected shape of payloads for common operations (projects, tasks, users).
- Component Library: Documentation for reusable UI components, props, and usage examples.
- State and Hooks: Details on useAuth, useFetch, and other custom hooks; recommended patterns for data loading and error handling.
- Theming and Styling: Guidance on Tailwind usage (if styled) and how to adapt visuals for branding.

The documentation aims to be concise where possible but thorough enough to support new contributors and new team members.

---

## 🧭 Getting Involved

- Find an issue you can tackle or propose a small feature reform.
- Create a new branch, implement the feature, and write tests if applicable.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.
- Respect the code conventions and ensure the application remains stable and readable.

If you want to contribute to the frontend, start by exploring the authentication flow, the project dashboard, and the task list. These areas touch most of the app’s core interactions.

---

## 🧰 Common Patterns and Conventions

- Components are built as small, independent pieces with well-defined props.
- State is lifted only when necessary; otherwise, components manage their own local state.
- API interactions are centralized to reduce duplication and to make retries and error handling consistent.
- Routes are declared in a single location, with guards for authentication and authorization.
- Environment-specific behavior is controlled via .env files, with a safe default for local development.

These patterns help keep the codebase predictable and extensible as the project grows.

## 🗂️ Directory and File Details

- src/
  - assets/: Visuals used by the UI
  - components/: UI blocks like Button, Card, Modal, Input
  - contexts/: App-wide context providers
  - hooks/: Custom logic like useAuth, useFetch
  - pages/: Feature canvases like Dashboard, Projects, Tasks
  - routes/: The route configuration and private routes
  - services/: API clients and helpers
  - styles/: Tailwind or CSS resources
  - App.jsx: Entry point for routing and layout
  - main.jsx: Bootstrapping the React app
- public/: Static assets, favicon, manifest
- .env.local.example: A sample environment file
- README.md: This guide

If you explore the code, you’ll notice a deliberate separation of concerns. Components focus on visuals and interactivity, while hooks and contexts handle data logic and shared state. The services layer isolates API calls so you can mock them during testing or swap in a different backend without changing UI code.

---

## 🧭 Local Testing and Debug Scenarios

- Authentication tests: Verify login, signup, and logout flows. Ensure tokens are stored securely and are sent with API requests.
- Data loading: Check loading indicators when fetching lists of projects and tasks.
- Error scenarios: Simulate API errors to ensure user-friendly messages appear and retries are offered when applicable.
- Role-based UI: Switch between roles to confirm that UI elements appear or disappear according to permissions.
- Responsive checks: Validate layout behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

For more robust testing, consider adding end-to-end tests for the most critical user journeys, such as creating a project with tasks, assigning owners, and updating task statuses.
